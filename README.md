A simple mixin to add configuration functionality to your classes

## Installation

TODO: Replace `UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_PRIOR_TO_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG` with your gem name right after releasing it to RubyGems.org. Please do not do it earlier due to security reasons. Alternatively, replace this section with instructions to install your gem from git if you don't plan to release to RubyGems.org.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add configem

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install configem

## Usage

```sh
class Example1
  include Configem
end

class Example2
  extend Configem
end

class Example3
  prepend Configem
end

Example1.configure do |config|
  config.api_key_1 = "api_key_1_value"
end

Example2.configure do |config|
  config.api_key_2 = "api_key_2_value"
end

Example3.configure do |config|
  config.api_key_3 = "api_key_3_value"
end

puts Example1.config.api_key_1

puts Example2.config.api_key_2

puts Example3.config.api_key_3
```
